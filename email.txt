Hello Andrew,

Pamela and Elise gave me your contact information and said you were amazing.

I'm reaching out because I need your help. I moved here from Europe 2 years ago on a fianc√© visa with my wife, but we unfortunately broke up recently and have since filed for divorce. (Awkwardly, the divorce won't be finalized before my green card expires in August). I'm confident I can provide the necessary proof that our marriage was real, but I'm not sure what happens with the limbo between my green card expiry (August) and the likely date of our divorce finalization (November or so, if we did all the paperwork right).

I look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you!
Tal
