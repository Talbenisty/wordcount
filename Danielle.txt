Hey Tal, 20 December 2016 at 16:16 ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ I had a 40 min chat with Rabbi Mychal today, she really helped me in just that short time. She understood even with limited background, and probed insightfully. She seems to really get what I'm dealing with, as well as interpret where you're coming from and validating how difficult this whole thing is on so many levels. She broke things down into short term (what to do with going home and seeing my family, how nervous I'm feeling going "back" and how to interact with you), medium term (how moving out and trying to cope with the heartache and disappointment and new things), and long term (figuring out what Judaism means to me or what I might want from it, and what about it feels like a fit or not)... she's really insightful and gave me good proactive tips that already provide some peace of mind. We set up a time to meet in person Jan 5th, at 11:30am (Downtown) and I hope you would be willing to join. It's not like a last ditch effort to change your mind, no traps I promise! I would just really appreciate it if we talked to her together, since she has a broad perspective and has seen so much. This isn't a demand, you can say no. But my hope is that you come since there are things that I still need clarity on, things you can really only speak to. She and I talked about the expectations, she doesn't have any angle other than offering what she's seen from the many couples who grapple with religion/culture, no matter what they come in as or how they decide to move from there (separately or together). Let me know if the time does/doesn't work, she can only meet on the 5th but seemed flexible anytime between 11 and 2, possibly later. Also let me know if you have doubts/questions pertaining to this and I'll do my best. <3 Danielle Danielle Cleaver <danielleruthcleaver@gmail.com> To: Tal Benisty <benoche@gmail.com> Any thoughts about joining me?

Tal Benisty <benoche@gmail.com> good morning 4 messages Danielle Cleaver <danielleruthcleaver@gmail.com> To: Tal Benisty <benoche@gmail.com> Good morning love. 23 May 2012 at 00:28 I tried so hard not to wake you up, I hope you got better sleep than me. I am so dead and look like it... (plus there is a crisis here regarding identification cards, apparently it ́s necessary for every student but no one knew it so we are at a loss of what to do.) Can ́t wait to crash at lunch, or when I get home. Just wanted to say I love you. Mucho. Take this day for yourself if you want, but know that I ́m also here if you need. I ́ll be thinking about you all day. Yours, ­D Tal Benisty <benoche@gmail.com> To: Danielle Cleaver <danielleruthcleaver@gmail.com> Good morning babe! 23 May 2012 at 01:05 I did not wake up at all. You move with divine stealth :) I am so so so so so tired babe. We're wednesday today. That's 7 days since I slept anywhere near 7 hours. I'm listening to To build you a home. What a beautiful beautiful song. I'm truly sorry about last night. There isn't a single word from that conversation that I don't take back. Te amo, Tal [Quoted text hidden] ­­ Tal Benisty | www.talbenisty.com | Interaction Designer Danielle Cleaver <danielleruthcleaver@gmail.com> To: Tal Benisty <benoche@gmail.com> 23 May 2012 at 03:19 I totally understand the tiredness, I ́m on my 3rd cup of coffee and everyone has asked me how I feel because my eyes are still puffy and red... and I thought I was so sneaky with my make­up today. heh The worst part is that I tutor for 2 hours today, til 7. I don ́t know how I ́m going to last til then....I might ask Marta to let me leave early and take half the pay. I can ́t believe you ́ve been going non­stop for a week. Maybe you could work a few hours less to go home and crash before the funeral, then on Friday stay til 6 (like you would do anyway) to make it up? The kids are doing so well, most of my "prepping" them for the exam is calming them down with silly dances or deep breathing or asking them last minute questions and high fives for the easy ones to boost their confidence. The examiner is so easy going and nice, so they have all come out of it feeling good. One 9 year old girl asked the one who had just finished "es guapo??" It was so funny, the teacher was laughing and I fake "drowned" her as she was giggling. So the morning hasn ́t been so bad. Remind me to listen to that song when I have sound. I think I ́ll start reading that article you sent me about Kurt V. I ́m sorry too. I ́ll watch out for what my "goal" is when I open my mouth about matters like last night... I find that when I don ́t, the natural way it flows is a bit chaotic and results have not been good so far... I love you and hope that we don ́t have to abolish discussions about touchy topics just because of unchecked reactions or lack of foresight. I love getting your input and value it even when I don ́t agree with or like it. You ́re working on sensitivity during jokes, I can work on my sensitivity to serious subjects. As for the tears, can ́t do anything about em... they are pre­programmed and enhanced on these baby meds. :/ Thanks for your patience and affection, it helps me not feel like a weakling when you are tender with me. I knew you were sad last night and I absorbed it, but even when I am low with you, I want you to be able to lean on me too, k? I might not look strong when I ́m crying but I can rise to the occasion if/when you need me. Je t ́aime.

Tal Benisty <benoche@gmail.com> Upon crash landing into my pillow... 1 message Danielle Cleaver <danielleruthcleaver@gmail.com> 18 July 2012 at 23:24 To: Tal Benisty <benoche@gmail.com> I'm sitting up in bed, wearing your green shirt and wishing it smelt more like you and less like my stuffy suitcase, lamenting this horrible time difference. I know that you won't wake up for at least an hour (even with this "early work" scam, I doubt you'll ever get out of the house before 8:30 ;) ) I'm so tired from a full day of work plus going for a night drive with Laurie through Carbon Canyon, our favorite drive to take while talking about life and jokes and dreams and fears... The roads are beautifully quiet and smooth, winding through the darkness of wild canyons and hills on either side. It amazes me how much vast wildness is right in our backyard. There are always construction cones around, indicating repaving in progress or streetlight installation. I wouldn't believe they were real because it's still pitch black and it's been under construction since last summer, but the gorgeous twisting roads are so creamy and dark that I acknowledge and appreciate the works. To us, they are more like markers on a racetrack... Laurie even attempted zig zagging through a couple cones and almost succeeded! :) We had a great time, in all respects. I hate that on these early morning work days, I'm just too beat to stay up much later than 11 pm. Maybe my stamina will grow as I adjust to the work flow and recover from travelling and being "new" here again. Luckily next week I'm scheduled for mid­day shifts, 11:30­8:00. It's perfect, in my opinion, because I don't have to worry about going to sleep early before and I don't have my fun night hours occupied. The worst part of the shift is that I have no "daytime" free for summer activities like the beach or park or shopping or whathaveyou (one word?) Oh! I'm scheduled 40 hrs next week, and since I'll be officially done "training" my commissions will begin and that means real money coming in! Other than insurance and my phone payment, I haven't touched or spent a dollar since I've arrived, trying to hold off as much as possible. That will probably go out the window when I go shopping for my party on Sun. I started talking about you tonight with Laurie and got a tangible ache in my chest. We weren't even talking about this, but all of a sudden I thought about your nose nuzzled against my neck and how warm and fuzzy it feels. I imagined it so vividly that I can barely believe it was all recreated in my mind for that split second. Anyway, I read another chapter of the book you gave me. It's so mind blowing, I love his metaphors so that you can visualize the concepts and then I get excited and want to share it with someone. My dad's a reader, so we were across from each other in the living room and he liked hearing my excitement about astronomy, a particular passion of his. Speaking of nerdy stuff, if you are looking for another time­filler funny show, I saw a Big Bang episode today and it was more than funny enough! It is in the sitcom genre, but you can't help but hate/enjoy Sheldon. :) What, a, character! My eyes are actually drooping right now and I've got to wake up in 7 hours. I was just going to pop on my email to tell you that I miss you and can't help thinking of it every time I climb into bed. Or brush my teeth. Or shower. Or see something that makes me laugh/smile.... basically, I miss you a whole lot of the times. All of the times, even! ;) But apparently, I had a little more to say, hehe. I love you babe. Have a fantastic day at work, thanks for sending me links and articles, they are awesome fillers when it's slow. Plus I love knowing what is of interest to you at the moment. I hope we can gchat more tomorrow, I think work/being apart is much more bearable when I'm in a good mood from my amazing boyfriend who always knows how to get me smiling. :) Love, Your Danielle
